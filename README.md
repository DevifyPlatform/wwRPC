**wwRPC** is a lightweight and very fast RPC (remote producre call) implementation in Node.js for a peer-to-peer IoT network.

# wwRPC: web-to-web RPC

wwRPC uses REST-style RPC operations over WebSocket for Web of Things. wwRPC aims to support REST-style physical devices and virtual things. It is the infrastructure of [WoT.City](https://wotcity.com) software framework for a peer-to-peer and machine-to-machine IoT network. It also aims to support [RPC-style endpoints](https://github.com/DevifyPlatform/devify-server/tree/master/templates/201-web-of-things-dashboard).
